# Automated Detection of Arterial Blood Pressure Signal Integrity Failures

**A Reproducible Research Repository for the IEEE JBHI Submission**

---

## 📊 Abstract

This study presents the first systematic audit of Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) signal integrity in open clinical databases. We analyzed 400 five-minute ABP windows from two major databases: **VitalDB** (a surgical ICU database from Korea) and **CHARIS** (a traumatic brain injury ICU database from the USA). Our automated auditing framework, based on established physiological plausibility checks, revealed a staggering **74.2% combined failure rate**. The failure rate was **97.8% in VitalDB** and **25.4% in CHARIS**, highlighting significant, database-specific data quality issues. We further developed and validated a Random Forest-based machine learning model to automate this auditing process, achieving a **ROC-AUC of 0.994** and **PR-AUC of 1.000**. This work establishes that signal integrity auditing is a mandatory prerequisite for the development of trustworthy medical AI and provides a reproducible framework for conducting such audits.

## 🚀 Key Findings

| Database | Total Windows | FAIL | PASS | Failure Rate |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **VitalDB** | 270 | 264 | 6 | **97.8%** |
| **CHARIS** | 130 | 33 | 97 | **25.4%** |
| **Combined** | **400** | **297** | **103** | **74.2%** |

- **Systemic Data Quality Issues**: The high failure rates across two distinct databases indicate that ABP signal integrity is a widespread, systemic problem in open clinical repositories.
- **Database-Specific Variance**: The significant difference in failure rates (97.8% vs. 25.4%) underscores that data quality is highly variable and cannot be assumed.
- **High-Performance Automation**: Our ML model can automate the detection of these failures with near-perfect accuracy, enabling scalable quality control.

## ⚙️ How to Reproduce Results

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd abp-signal-integrity
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the final verification script:**
    This script will re-calculate all statistics from the raw data files in the `/data` directory and print a final, verified report.
    ```bash
    cd src
    python3 FINAL_VERIFICATION_CODE.py
    ```

4.  **Expected Output:**
    The script will generate a `VERIFICATION_RESULTS.txt` file in the `results` directory, confirming all the numbers presented in the paper.
